## 1. Introduction

South Korea relies on foreign imports for 92.8 percent of its energy resources as of the first half of 2020 [^1]. Among the energy resources, the Korea Gas Corporation(KOGAS) imports Liquified Natural Gas(LNG) from around world and supplies it to power generation plants, gas-utility companies and city gas companies throughout the country [^2]. It produces and supplies Natural Gas(NG), in order to ensure stable gas supply for the nation. And it operates LNG storage tanks at LNG acquisition bases which can store LNG during the season when city gas demand is low and replenish LNG during winter when demand is higher than supply [^3]. 

The wholesale charges consist of raw material costs (LNG introduction and incidental costs) and gas supply costs [^4]. Therefore, the forecasting NG demand/supply will not only help establish an optimized mid-to-long-term plan for the introduction of LNG, but also stable NG supply and economic effects.

Explain the factors affecting gas demand: climate(temperature, precipitation), the other energy price(crude oil, coal), exchange rate(USD)

The related works are.

## 2. Report Format

The report is written in (hugo) markdown and not commonmark. As such some features are not visible in GitHub. You can 
set up hugo on your local computer if you want to see how it renders or commit and wait 10 minutes once your report is 
bound into cybertraining.

It is to be noted that markdown works best if you include an empty line before and after each context change. 
Thus the following is wrong:

```
# This is My Headline
This author does ignore proper markdown while not using empty lines between context changes
1. This is because this author ignors all best practices
```

Instead, this should be 

```
# This is My Headline

We do not ignore proper markdown while using empty lines between context changes

1. This is because we encourage best practices to cause issues.
```

## 2.1. GitHub Actions

When going to GitHub Actions you will see a report is autmatically generated with some help on improving your markdown. 
We will not review any document that does not pass this check.

## 2.2. PAst Copy from Word or other Editors is a Disaster!

We recommend that you sue a proper that is integrated with GitHub or you use the commandline tools. We may include 
comments into your document that you will have to fix, If you juys past copy you will 

1. Not learn how to use GitHub properly and we deduct points
2. Overwrite our coments that you than may miss and may result in point deductions as you have not addressed them.

## 2.3. Report or Project

You have two choices for the final project. 

1. Project, That is a final report that includes code.
2. Report, that is a final project without code.

YOu will be including the type of the project as a prefix to your title, as well as in the Type tag
at the beginning of your project.

## 3. Using Images

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 4. Using itemized lists only where needed

Remember this is not a powerpoint presentation, but a report so we recommend

1. Use itemized or enumeration lists sparingly
2. When using bulleted lists use * and not - 

## 3. Datasets

There is an NG supply dataset[^5] from a public data portal in South Korea. It includes four years from 2016 to 2019 of regional monthly NG supply in the nine different cities of South Korea. In addition, climate data such as temperature and precipitation[^6] for the same period can be obtained from the Korea Meteorological Administration. Similarly, data on the price of four types of crude oil[^7] and various types of coal price datasets per month[^8] are also available through corresponding agencies. Finally, the Won-Dollar exchange rate dataset[^9] with the same period is used.

As mentioned above, each dataset has monthly information. It is regionally separated or combined according to the test scenario. For example, the NG supply dataset has nine different cities. One column of cities is split from the original dataset and merged with another regional dataset like temperature or precipitation. On the other hand, in the case of the test scenario, where a national dataset is needed, the summation value of all column data is created and used for it.

The dataset is applied differently for each scenario. In the scenario one, all dataset such as crude oil price, coal price, exchange rate, and regional temperature and precipitation are merged with regional dataset, especially seoul city. For the scenario two, all climate dataset are used with regional dataset. Only temperature dataset is utilized with regional dataset in the scenario three. In addition, in the scenario four, all cases are the same as in the scenario one, but the timesteps are changed to two months. Finally, national dataset is used for the scenario five. 

## 4. Methodology

## 4.1. Min-Max scaling

In this project, all datasets are rescaled between 0 and 1 by Min-Max scaling, one of the most common normalization methods. If there is a feature with anonymous data, The maximum value(max(x)) of data is converted to 1, and the minimum value(min(x)) of data is converted to 0. The other values between the maximum value and the minimum value get converted to x', between 0 and 1.

## 4.2. Training

For forecasting the NG supply amount from the time series dataset, MLP with LSTM network model is designed by using Tensorflow. The first and second LSTM layers have 100 units, and a total of 3 layers of MLP follow it. Each MLP layer has 100 neurons instead of the final layer, where its neuron is 1. In addition, dropout was designated to prevent overfitting of data, Adam is used as an optimizer, and Rectified Linear Unit(Relu) as an activation function.

## 4.3. Evaluation

To evaluate this network model, Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) are applied. The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors and is presented by the formula as following, where n is the number of errors, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y_i"> is the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i%5E%7Bth%7D"> true value, and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Chat%7By_i%7D"> is the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i%5E%7Bth%7D"> predicted value.

Also, The RMSE is used for observing the differences between the real dataset and prediction values. The following is the formula of RMSE, and each value of this is same for MAE.

## 4.4. Prediction

Since the datasets used for the training are normalized between 0 and 1, they get converted to a range of the ground truth values. From these rescaled datasets, it is possible to obtain the RMSE and compare the differences between a actual value and a predicted value.

## 5. Result

In all scenarios, main variables such as dropout, learning rate and epochs starts under the same conditions and are 0.1, 0.0005, and 100 in order. These variables are adjusted according to the circumstances and comprehensively compared at the end of this part. 

## 5.1 Scenario one(regional dataset)

The final MAE of train set is around 0.05 and the one of test set is around 0.19. The RMSE between real data and predicted data is around 227018. The predictive graph tends to deviate a lot at the beginning of epochs, but it shows quite a bit of agreement at the end of epochs.

## 5.2 Scenario two(regional climate dataset)

The final MAE of train set is around 0.10 and the one of test set is around 0.14. The RMSE between real data and predicted data is around 185205. Although the predictive graph still differ compared to real graph, it shows similar trends in shape.

## 5.3 Scenario three(regional temperature dataset)

The final MAE of train set is around 0.13 and the one of test set is around 0.14. The RMSE between real data and predicted data is around 207585. While the tendency to follow high and low seems similar, but changes in the middle seem to be misleading.

## 5.4 Scenario four(applying timesteps)

The final MAE of train set is around 0.06 and the one of test set is around 0.30. The RMSE between real data and predicted data is around 340843. Out of all scenarios, the predictive graph shows to have the most differences. However, in the last part, there is a somewhat similar tendency.

## 5.5 Scenario five(national dataset)

The final MAE of train set is around 0.03 and the one of test set is around 0.14. The RMSE between real data and predicted data is around 587340. the largest RMSE value is the result, but direct comparisons are not possible because the baseline volume is different from other scenarios. Although the predictive graph shows differences, it tends to be similar to the results in the scenario two.
