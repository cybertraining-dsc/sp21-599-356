**Assignment 5: Add onto Homework 3**

1\. Decide if you want to keep studying the topic you chose in homework
3 and increase the depth of work.

\- I would like to keep studying the topic that I chose in Assignment 3,
especially the third topic: Forecasting natural gas demand.

2\. If the answer to a) is no, then homework 5 is to repeat homework 3
for a different application (transition).

\- If it is determined that there is no appropriate data after data
collection, or if it is determined that the algorithm related to this
topic cannot be found, the direction of the topic may need to be
slightly changed. For example, not forecasting the demand, but
forecasting the price or something related.

3\. If the the answer to a) is yes, then take your area and look online
for an AI algorithm related to your study that has 1) some open-source
data and 2) either a description of analysis with enough detail to
identify AI algorithms or an open-source GitHub with relevant software.
You can be broad-minded \-- protein structure and material structure use
similar methods and perhaps the stock market acts like earthquakes or
other time series. We would like each student to eventually identify a
simple illustrative deep learning example that uses
networks/architecture similar to "production system". This study will
evolve into the final project.
